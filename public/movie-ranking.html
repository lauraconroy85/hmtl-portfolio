<h3>Empire Records</h3>

<p>This movie makes me laugh. I really enjoy each characters' personalities.</p>

<h3>Boondock Saints</h3>

<p>This movie has a lot of action and vulgarity, but still has a great deal of humor.</p>

<h3>It's a Wonderful Life</h3>

<p>This was my favorite movie to watch with my Mom and Dad during the holidays. It was part of our tradition every year after putting up the tree.</p>
